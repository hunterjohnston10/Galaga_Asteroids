This game is called Galaga Asteriods, a very creative name because this game 
has influences from both Asteriods and Galaga.

The controls are simple:

A -> Shoot
B -> Boost
Up -> Go Up
Down -> Go Down
Left -> Go Left
Right -> Go Right
Select -> Return to Title Screen

The rules are also very simple. Avoid the enemies (depicted by the bugs from
Galaga). You can shoot them to kill them and recieve 100 points and 10 boost.
You earn 10 points each second you are alive, too. The enemies get faster
the longer you are alive, so watch out. Once you get hit 3 times by the
enemies, you lose. Have fun and thanks for playing!
